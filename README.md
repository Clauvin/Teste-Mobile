## Design Patterns Used

*Facade* - MainPanelManagerScript and FeedbackPanelManagerScript are referenced a lot by all the buttons in the program to switch panels around, instead of each button doing the switching by themselves.

*Strategy* - Unity does it by default: basically ALL MonoBehaviour derived classes can be added to any GameObject, which makes Monobehaviour a father of a huge family of interchangeable scripts.

*Prototype* - Sort of. Prefabs in Unity are base objects which can be instantiated through a simple call to Instantiate(...). We used that to make testing easier a few times.
